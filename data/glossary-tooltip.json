  "vertical intercept": "The point where the graph crosses the vertical axis. ",
  "vertical line": "A vertical line is the graph of an equation of the form \\( x = a . \\) The line passes through the <em>x</em>-axis at \\( \\left(\\right. a , 0 \\left.\\right) . \\)",
  "vertical line test": "A set of points in a rectangular coordinate system is the graph of a function if every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point.",
  "vertical reflection": "A transformation in which a function reflects over the x-axis.",
  "vertical shift": "A vertical shift is a type of transformation that moves a parent function up or down.",
  "vertical stretch": "A transformation that occurs when a parent function is multiplied by a constant greater than one, causing the graph to become skinnier.",
  "weak relationship": "A relationship between two numerical variables is weak if the data is loosely spread&nbsp;around the best fit line.",
  "x-intercept": "The point(s) where the graph crosses the horizontal axis.",
  "y-intercept": "The point where the graph crosses the vertical axis. ",
  "zero (of a function)": "A value of \\( x \\) where the function is 0, is called a zero of the function.",
  "zero exponent property": "According to the zero exponent property, <em>a</em> to the zero is 1 as long as <em>a</em> is not zero.",
  "zero of the function": "A value of \\( x \\) where the function is 0, is called a zero of the function.",
  "zero product property": "The zero product property says that if the product of two quantities is zero, then at least one of the quantities is zero.",
