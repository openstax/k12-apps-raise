# Supporting interactive content for RAISE

One of the goals of the code in this repository is to support content developers in implementing interactive experiences within Moodle's standard Page and Lesson activities which may otherwise be constrained to static HTML. Moreover, the implementations are intended to allow for generating event data that can be provided to researchers. We define the following abstractions accordingly:

* **Interactive Block**: A basic primitive that can be combined with others to implement interactive content. The core value here is that for content developers an Interactive Block is described in HTML markup without any concern for the underlying implementation (e.g. the HTML / Javascript / CSS code that brings it to life).

* **Content Template**: A combination of one or more Interactive Blocks that represents a specific interactive experience.

This document provides schema definitions supported Interactive Blocks as well as examples of Content Templates.
